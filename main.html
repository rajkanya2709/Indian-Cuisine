<div class="bblue"> India is a Coutry which is widely famous for its Varity of Cuisine.No country uses a wider range of spices in its cuisine than India. Those spices give Indian food its distinctively complex fragrance and flavor, but they can seem like a bit of a hurdle for folks who haven’t cooked Indian food at home. But the most common Indian spices can be found in grocery stores—the difference is how they’re combined and used in recipes. Food is integral part of Indian temple and religious experience. In Indian temples, meal is served not only during festivals and holidays but temple and its visitor regular offers food.The cuisine of India is one of the world's most diverse cuisines, characterized by its sophisticated and subtle use of the many spices, vegetables, grains and fruits grown across India. The cuisine of each geographical region includes a wide assortment of dishes and cooking techniques reflecting the varied demographics of the ethnically diverse Indian subcontinent. India's religious beliefs and culture have played an influential role in the evolution of its cuisine. Vegetarianism is widely practiced in many Hindu, Buddhist and Jain communities.India’s unique blend of cuisines evolved through large-scale cultural interactions with neighboring Persia, ancient Greece, Mongols and West Asia. New World foods such as chili peppers, tomatoes, potatoes and squash, introduced by Arab and Portuguese traders during the sixteenth century, and European cooking styles introduced during the colonial period added to the diversity of Indian cuisine.</div>

<h2><u><i><b><a name="History">History</a></b></i></u></h2>

<div class="bblue">The cuisine of India has is considered one of the world’s most diverse cuisines. Extensive immigration and intermingling of cultures through many millennia has introduced many dietary and cultural influences. India's diverse climate, ranging from deep tropical to alpine, has made a broad range of ingredients readily available to its many schools of cookery. In many cases, food has become a marker of religious and social identity, with various taboos and preferences (for instance, a segment of the Jain population consume no roots or subterranean vegetable; see Jain vegetarianism) that have driven certain groups to innovate extensively with the food sources that are deemed acceptable.</div>
<div class="bblue">The longstanding vegetarianism within sections of India's Hindu, Buddhist and Jain communities has exerted a strong influence over Indian cuisine. People who follow a strict vegetarian diet make up 20–42 percent of the population in India, while less than 30 percent are regular meat-eaters.</div>
<div class="bblue">By around 7000 B.C.E., sesame, eggplant, and humped cattle had been domesticated in the Indus Valley.Many recipes first emerged during the initial Vedic period, when India was still heavily forested and agriculture was complemented with game hunting and products from the forest. In Vedic times, a normal diet consisted of fruit, vegetables, meat, grain, dairy products and honey.The ancient Hindu concept of ahimsa, a rule of conduct that prohibits the killing or injuring of living beings because violence entails negative karmic consequences,led some segments of the population to embrace vegetarianism. This practice gained more popularity following the advent of Buddhism in a cooperative climate where a variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains could easily be grown throughout the year. A food classification system that categorized every item as saatvic (pure), raajsic (active and passionate) or taamsic (heavy, dull, slow, gluttonous) developed in Ayurveda; each was deemed to have a powerful effect on the body and the mind.</div>
<div class="bblue">Later invasions from Central Asia, Arabia, the Mughal empire, and Persia, had a fundamental effect on Indian cooking. The Islamic conquest of medieval India introduced such fruits as apricots, melons, peaches, and plums, and rich gravies, pilafs and non-vegetarian fare such as kebabs, giving rise to Mughlai cuisine (Mughal in origin). The Mughals were great patrons of cooking; lavish dishes were prepared during the reigns of Jahangir and Shah Jahan. A blending of Mughlai and Telangana cuisines took place in the kitchens of the Nizams, historic rulers of Hyderabad state, resulting in the creation of Hyderabadi biryani, a traditional celebratory meal made using mutton or goat meat, basmati rice, yoghurt, onions, and spices, considered by many connoisseurs to be the finest of the main dishes in India.</div>
<div class="bblue">Influence from Arab and Portuguese traders resulted in diversified subcontinental tastes and meals. New-world vegetables such as tomato, chilies, squash, and potato, which were introduced during the sixteenth century, became staples of Indian cuisine. The British introduced European recipes and cooking techniques like baking.</div>

<h2><u><i><b><a name="Popularity">Popularity and influence outside India</a></b></i></u></h2>
<div class="bblue">ndian cuisine is one of the most popular cuisines across the globe. The cuisine is enjoyed not only among the large Indian diaspora but also by the general population in North America, Europe, Australia and parts of Africa. A survey held in 2007 revealed that more than 1200 Indian food products have been introduced in the United States since 2000.</div>
<div class="bblue">According to Britain's Food Standards Agency, Indian food industry in the United Kingdom is worth £3.2 billion, accounts for two-thirds of all eating out and serves about 2.5 million British customers every week.</div>
<div class="bblue">Indian cuisine is popular in <i>South East Asia</i> because of its strong historical influence on the region's local cuisines. The influence of Indian cuisine on <i>Malaysian cooking</i> styles dates to the nineteenth century. Spread of vegetarianism in other parts of Asia is often credited to <i>Ancient Indian Buddhist</i> practices. Indian cuisine is also enjoyed in the Arab world because of its similarity to and influence on Arab cuisine. Mchuzi (curry) is a common dish in East Africa, where it was introduced by Indian immigrants during the colonial period. Indian immigrants also introduced their cuisine to South Africa during the nineteenth century.</div>
<div class="bblue">Curry's international appeal has also been compared to that of pizza.</div>
<div class="bblue">Historically, Indian spices and herbs were one of the most sought after trade commodities. The spice trade between India and Europe led to the rise and dominance of Arab traders to such an extent that European explorers, such as Vasco da Gama and Christopher Columbus, set out to find new trade routes with India, launching the Age of Discovery.</div>

<h2><u><i><b><a name="Tea">Beverages</a></b></i></u></h2>
<img src="tea.jpg"width="400"height="400" alt="Tea">
<div class="bblue">Tea is a staple beverage throughout India; the finest varieties are grown in Darjeeling and Assam. It is generally prepared as masala chai, by boiling the tea leaves in a mixture of water, spices such as cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and ginger, and large quantities of milk to create a thick, sweet, milky concoction. Different varieties and flavors of tea are prepared all over the country. Another popular beverage, coffee, is largely served in South India. One of the finest varieties of Coffea arabica is grown around Mysore, Karnataka, and is marketed under the trade name <i>"Mysore Nuggets".</i> Indian filter coffee, or kaapi, is especially popular in South India. Other beverages include nimbu pani (lemonade), lassi (made by blending yogurt with water, salt, pepper, ice and spices until frothy), chaach, badam doodh (milk with nuts and cardamom), sharbat (juice prepared from fruits or flower petals) and coconut water.</div>

<div class="bblue">India also has many indigenous alcoholic beverages, including palm wine, fenny, bhang and Indian beer. The practice of drinking a beverage with a meal, or wine and food matching, is not traditional or common in India. People prefer to consume drinking water with their food, and it is customary to offer drinking water to guests before serving hot or cold drinks. </div>

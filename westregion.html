	<div>Western India has three major food groups: Gujarati, Maharashtrian and Goan. There are two main types of Maharashtrian cuisine, defined by geographical circumstances. The coastal regions, geographically similar to Goa, consume more rice, coconut, and fish. In the hilly regions of the Western Ghats and Deccan plateau, groundnut is used in place of coconut and the staples are jowar (sorghum) and bajra (millet) as staples. Saraswat cuisine forms an important part of coastal Konkani Indian cuisine.Gujarati cuisine is predominantly vegetarian. Many Gujarati dishes have a hint of sweetness due to use of sugar or brown sugar. The typical Gujarati meal consists of Rotli (a flat bread made from wheat flour), daal or kadhi, rice, and sabzi/shaak (a dish made up of different combinations of vegetables and spices, which may be stir fried, spicy or sweet). Staples include homemade pickles, Khichdi (rice and lentil or rice and mung bean daal), and chhaas (buttermilk). Main dishes are based on steamed vegetables and daals that are added to a vaghaar, which is a mixture of spices sterilized in hot oil that varies depending on the main ingredient. Salt, sugar, lemon, lime, and tomato are used frequently to prevent dehydration in an area where temperatures reach 50C (120F) in the shade.</div>
	<div>The cuisine of Goa is influenced by its Hindu origins, Portuguese colonialism, and modern techniques. The staple food of Goans is rice and fish and the cuisine is mostly seafood-based. Kingfish (Vison or Visvan) is the most common delicacy; others include pomfret, shark, tuna and mackerel. Popular shellfish include crabs, prawns, tiger prawns, lobster, squid and mussels. Goan Hindu cuisine is less spicy, uses little or no onion or garlic, and incorporates a variety of vegetables, lentils, pumpkins, gourds, bamboo shoots, and roots. Goan Christian cuisine includes beef dishes and the well-known Vindaloo, first introduced by the Portuguese as "vinha d'alhos."</div>

<a name="Khaman"><h2>Khaman - The Sponge Snack</h2></a>
<div>A tasty and healthy steamed snack made from freshly ground lentils and chickpea flour, it is very similar to its humble cousin, the world-famous -dhokla. To prepare the khaman, the khaman flour mix is boiled along with turmeric, salt and baking soda to make it light and fluffy. It is then cut up into cubes and usually garnished with mustard seeds, coriander leaves, sev and chopped onions. Traditionally served on a large green leaf called the Kesuda, the modern, urban version is served in newspapers in farsan (snack) shops with tangy chutneys and several pieces of green chillies. Popular adaptations of the khaman include Ameri khaman (mashed up khaman garnished with sev and pomegranate), Nylon khaman (softer and fast-cooking khaman) and Masala khaman (khaman served with hot and spicy chilly powder)</div>

<a name="Thepla"><h2>Thepla - A Snack that every Gujarati Swear by!</h2></a>
<div>No Gujarati journeys, picnics, foreign trips or even business trips are complete without this ubiquitous snack. Made from gram flour, whole wheat flour, fresh fenugreek leaves and spices, these flatbreads are healthy snacking options with a long shelf life. Usually served piping hot with fresh curd, pickles or chundo, they make wholesome meals. When accompanied by a cup of steaming hot tea, they also make a sumptuous breakfast or a great snack during the monsoon. Although the methi (fenugreek) ones are the most common, other varieties include palak (spinach), amaranth or muli (raddish) theplas-specially recommended for fussy eaters.</div>

<a name="Khandvi"><h2>Khandvi - The Delectable Gujarati Naashta</h2></a>
<div>Thin layers of gram flour cooked with buttermilk and rolled up in mushy goodness, seasoned with sautéed sesame seeds and a few other spices, that's khandvi for you. The simple but aromatic garnishing of curry leaves, coriander, sautéed cumin, mustard and coconut makes it simply irresistible.  Also called 'suralichya wadya' in Maharashtra, it is a popular snack among Gujaratis and Maharashtrians alike. Although loved by all, no one can deny that this dish is a little tricky to cook, especially getting the consistency of the batter right. Light on the stomach and pleasing on the tongue, khandvi can be a perfect breakfast item or a delectable evening snack.</div>

<a name="Undhiyu"><h2>Undhiyu - The Winter Delicacy</h2></a>
<div>The king of Gujarati dishes Undhiyu (and of course Uttarayan) is the reason why a Gujarati eagerly awaits winter. It derives its name from the Gujarati word undhu, meaning inverted, it is a classical Gujarati dish made in an inverted clay pot. It is a special winter delicacy made from the choicest of fresh produce readily available in winter. Common ingredients include eggplant, crunchy muthiyas (fried chickpea flour dumplings), potatoes, yam, green peas, bananas and beans, slow-cooked to perfection with buttermilk, coconut and spices. Undhiyu served with puris and shrikhand is a common occurrence during Gujarati weddings.</div>

<a name="Muthiya"><h2> Muthiya - The snack you couldn't say no to!</h2></a>
<div>Named after the action that is used to shape the dough, these fist-cakes make for a great breakfast or evening snack. To prepare these, a mixture of chickpea flour, bottle gourd and spices is prepared, steamed, pan-fried and seasoned. If you skip the pan-frying, it becomes a great meal for the health-conscious folks. Other varieties include usage of spinach, fenugreek, amaranth or even bitter gourd. Juicy and fluffy on the inside, golden and crispy on the outside, no one can ever say no to a bowlful of muta hiya. Best relished with a dash of mint-coriander chutney or ketchup, and a cup of steaming hot tea. Try this Gujarati dish to know what it is all about.</div>

<a name="Handvo"><h2>Handvo - The Savoury Cake</h2></a>
<div>Traditionally prepared over charcoal or in a pressure cooker, handvo is essentially a savory cake. To prepare handvo, a batter of lentils and rice is prepared and fermented overnight, and then baked. They are sometimes also pan-fried to make them crispy and golden, and the sesame seed seasoning makes them just irresistible! These nutritious pan-fried or baked lentil cakes are a very popular one-dish meal in Gujarati households. Like most other Gujarati snacks, they are best enjoyed with tangy green chutney and a hot cuppa.</div>

<a name="Fafda-Jalebi"><h2> Fafda-Jalebi - The Dream Cheat Day Breakfast!</h2></a>
<div>Made hugely popular by the daily soap 'Taarak Mehta ka Ulta Chashma'?, this is (almost) every Gujarati's dream cheat-day breakfast. Fafda is a crunchy, fried chickpea flour snack, jalebi is a sweet deep-fried pretzel made of wheat flour and dipped in sugar. Together, they are a match made in heaven. When you take a piece of the crunchy, salty, spicy fafda and eat it with a piece of the crunchy, sweet jalebi, you are sure to be in food heaven. Have a fried chilly or a whip of the dry papaya chutney with this combination, and your taste buds will burst away to glory. Almost every street corner in Gujarat, esp. Ahmedabad has a shop selling these. On Sundays, there are huge queues outside farsan shops, for an indulgent breakfast of this heavenly duo.</div>

<div>Pithla Bhakri is the recurrent ?comfort food? for most of the Maharashtrians. In fact, it is also known as the Farmer's meal in the state. Mostly, the hot pithra is united with bhakri and even roti at times as a reward after a long and tiring day at work. This simple dish doesn't require either too many complex ingredients or a lot of time to prepare. Instead, its the best dish to come up with when you are out of veggies. Mostly, pithla which is served with rice has a watery-liquid like consistency and a semi-liquid or dry pithla goes perfectly with bhakri or roti. A spicy version of the same is known as Zunka.</div>

<a name="Puran Poli"><h2>Puran Poli</h2></a>

This sweet is Ganpati's favourite and that is for a very definite reason for sure.</div>

<a name="Vada pav"><h2>Vada pav</h2></a>
<div>Vada Pav can easily be called the Indian version of a burger! A delicious, spicy, deep-fried patty made of potato is squeezed between a thick slice of bread, similar to a burger bun. Between the vada (patty) and pav (bread) a spicy mix of spices and salt is sprinkled and garnished with a fried, salted green chilli. Sounds perfect, isn't it? It's an all-day snack and is extremely popular among Maharashtrians. It is very economical, filling and easily accessible. Another popular offshoot is the Bhajiya Pav, which has batter-fried onions instead of the patty.</div>

<a name="Misal Pav"><h2>Misal Pav</h2></a>
<div>Misal Pav is quintessentially from Pune and is one of the most popular Maharashtrian breakfast, snack or even brunch. It is a street food popularly found in Mumbai.

Although it is a breakfast food but Maharashtrians enjoy it at time of the day. There are various types of Misal such as Puneri Missal (topped with poha), Nagpuri Missal, Kolhapuri Missal and Mumbai Missal which are very spicy.</div>

<a name="Ragda Pattice"><h2>Ragda Pattice</h2></a>
<div>The much famed Ragda Patties or as the locals would name it Ragda ?pattice? (a localised version on the English ?patties?) is a part of Maharashtra's delicious street food that one should never leave out on. It is a yet another lip-smacking street food in Mumbai which is prepared by using curried dried peas and patties. These potato patties are dipped in the Ragda gravy and topped with chaat chutneys, finely chopped onions, tomatoes, crispy sev and cilantro. The dish is regularly served at all restaurants in Maharashtra and is also an important part of the local street food as well.</div>

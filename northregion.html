	<div>North Indian cuisine is distinguished by the proportionally high use of dairy products; milk, paneer, ghee (clarified butter), and yoghurt (yogurt, yoghourt) are all common ingredients. Gravies are typically dairy-based. Other common ingredients include chilies, saffron, and nuts.</div>
	<div>North Indian cooking features the use of the "tawa" (griddle) for baking flat breads like roti and paratha, and "tandoor" (a large and cylindrical coal-fired oven) for baking breads such as naan, and kulcha; main courses like tandoori chicken are also cooked in the "tandoor," a cylindrical shaped clay oven. Other breads like puri and bhatoora, which are deep fried in oil, are also common. Goat and lamb meats are favored ingredients of many northern Indian recipes.</div>
	<div>The samosa is a popular North Indian snack, and now commonly found in other parts of India, Central Asia, North America, Africa and the Middle East. A common variety is filled with boiled, fried, or mashed potato. Other fillings include minced meat, cheese (paneer), mushroom (khumbi), and chick pea.</div>
	<div>The staple food of most of North India is a variety of lentils, vegetables, and roti (wheat based bread). The varieties used and the method of preparation can vary from place to place. Popular snacks, side-dishes and drinks include mirchi bada, buknu, bhujiya, chaat, kachori, imarti, several types of pickles (known as achar), murabba, sharbat, aam panna and aam papad. Popular sweets are known as mithai (meetha means sweet in Hindi), such as gulab jamun, jalebi, peda, petha, rewdi, gajak, bal mithai, singori, kulfi, falooda, khaja, ras malai, gulkand, and several varieties of laddu, barfi and halwa.</div>
	<div>Some common North Indian foods such as the various kebabs and most of the meat dishes originated with Muslims’ incursions into the country. Pakistani cuisine and north Indian cuisine are very similar, reflecting their shared historic and cultural heritage.</div>

<a name="Butter Chicken"><h2>Butter Chicken - The king of all Punjabi dishes!</h2>
<div>While chicken may very well be called the national bird of Punjab, butter chicken is the crowning jewel of the food of Punjab. While it may not have originated in Punjab, it was invented by a Punjabi family so that counts, right? No celebration can be complete without this delicacy. This creamy, gravy dish is lightly spiced and paired up with either naan or rumaali roti.</div>

<a name="Shakkar Para"><h2>Shakkar Para - A sweet, indulgent dish of Punjab!</h2>
<div>A great accompaniment to tea, it can also be snacked on when you're craving something a little sweet. Made from semolina and flour, it is light and not overly sweet. For those with a sweeter tooth, these can be coated in coarse sugar or desecrated coconut for a different flavour. These can be just as easily made at home and stored for 2-3 weeks to keep munching on! It is deep fried Punjabi Food so do be careful of how many you munch on.</div>

<a name="Lassi"><h2> Lassi</h2></a>
<div>A drink known far and wide, lassi is something Punjabi's pride themselves in. Though it can be salty, the original lassi as it became famous, is sweet with a dollop of cream and butter to make it as rich as you can. Flavours like mango rose or strawberry are added these days to give it a twist while beating the summer heat. Almost all restaurants serve this even if they're not Punjabi joints which show the popularity of this humble drink.</div>

<a name="Amritsari Chole"><h2>Amritsari Chole</h2></a>
<div>Be it Amritsari chole or Peshwari chole, they're both equally delicious, just the place of origin varies. A staple in Punjabi cuisine, this chickpea dish is best had with either a paratha or naan. Or you can just have spoonfuls of it as is, given how good it tastes. The difference between them is that Peshwari is slightly drier while Amritsar is made with a bit of gravy. The spices used are also different but not all that much. So it really depends on which part of the food of Punjab you feel like owning your allegiance to while ordering!</div>

<a name="Chole Bhature"><h2> Chole Bhature - Punjabi Food Fiesta!</h2></a>
<div>It's a standard Punjabi dish in most fast-food restaurants now. And these two accompany each other like a dream when you feel like indulging a little. Made with flour and milk rather than wheat flour, it's different from a poori. And although it's much larger than a poori, you can't just eat one because it's that tasty! The soft, slightly fermented bhatura should be your Go-to when you are craving some hardcore, spicy food of Punjab.</div>

<a name="Parantha"><h2>Parantha - The Staple Food of Punjab</h2></a>
<div>No matter who you are, chances are that you've had a parantha at least once in your life. This delectable offering has come to India through the annals of Punjabi cuisine, and what a discovery that was! Be it plain or stuffed, this bread is a staple of most Punjabi households. Even while travelling, the most preferred item to eat at a Dhaba is mostly always a paratha. Fried in desi ghee is the way most people in Punjab like it. Have with some cold curd and pickle, it is quite a humble match made in gastronomic heaven. The possibilities of the stuffings are endless. Be it potatoes, onions, cottage cheese, keema to newer variants like bottle gourd, mangoes and almost anything you could imagine! The popularity is a testament is a fact that the national capital also has an area 'parathewali gali' dedicated to serving up all possible varieties of it. Plus, like a roti, it doesn't even have to be round so you can definitely make it at home without being taunted about making a 'world map' in the name of food!</div>
